//functions vs methods
function func() {
  console.log("I am a function");
}

const person = {
  name: "mayank",
  greet() {
    console.log("I am a method");
  },
};

//pretty much above gives clear difference

//type of function???? It is OBJECT
//stored inside heap and stuff, same behaviour as object
